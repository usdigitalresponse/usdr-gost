## About

GOST is a platform that hosts tools to enable state and local government officials to more easily apply for and report on their federal grants. Feel free to make a contribution (see more [here](CONTRIBUTING.md)). Alternatively, if you'd like to volunteer with us in a more in-depth manner, you can sign up at [usdigitalresponse.org/volunteer](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/volunteer).

This application is currently hosted at grants.usdigitalresponse.org.

## Project Overview

This project consists of both a server application, built with node.js and [Express](https://expressjs.com/), and a client application, built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

There are two main parts to the application:

- The ID Tool (found at the main landing page of the site)
- The ARPA Reporter Tool (found at `/arpa_reporter`)
