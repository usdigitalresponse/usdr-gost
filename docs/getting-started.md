## Setup

The preferred way to set up this repository for local development is to use the standardized environment provided by [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See [Docker](#docker) section below for more detail on how to do this. It is also possible to set things up for local development, though this is generally not recommended.

### Docker
