## Setup

The preferred way to set up this repository for local development is to use the standardized environment provided by [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See [Docker](#docker) section below for more detail on how to do this. It is also possible to set things up for local development, though this is generally not recommended.

### Docker

Find instructions for using Docker-compose to do local development [here](../docker/README.md).

### Local

- For Mac/Linux, see [here](./setup-mac.md)
- For Windows, see [here](./setup-windows.md)
  - Note: these instructions also use Docker

## Development

See [here](./development.md) for more information on setting up for development with Docker or with a local environment. Includes details on running code, linting, debugging and styling.

## Common Tasks

See [here](./common-tasks) for some common development tasks you made need to do as part of your work.

## Testing

See more about testing [here](./testing.md).

## Deployment

See more about deployment [here](./deployment.md).
