## Overview

We use [feature flags (also called "feature toggles")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle)
in order to independently control whether certain client-side features are active in development,
staging, and production environments.

A few important things to keep in mind about feature flags:

1. Most feature flags will simply have a boolean value that toggles a new feature or behavior
on (when `true`) or off (when `false`).
2. Feature flags should generally reference new behavior rather than old/existing behaviors.
For example, a feature flag called `useNewLayout` is preferable to one called `useLegacyLayout`.
3. For clarity, feature flags should use affirmative names. For example, a feature flag called
`newLayoutEnabled` is preferable to one called `newLayoutDisabled`. This helps foster consistent
evaluation processes, where `true` is treated as "active" and `false` is treated as "inactive",
and promotes a general practice of treating feature flags as inactive-by-default.
4. Feature flags are **not** a security feature and should never be used to obscure or otherwise
prevent access to sensitive information.

## Client-Side Feature Flags

Client-side feature flags are read from the `window.APP_CONFIG.featureFlags` object and as such,
may be modified dynamically in your browser's development console.

### TL;DR

1. Use the `packages/client/src/helpers/featureFlags` library to provide access to feature
flags in client-side code, rather than accessing `window.APP_CONFIG.featureFlags` directly.
2. In development environments, feature flags are defined in
`packages/client/public/deploy-config.js`.
3. Call `window.APP_CONFIG.overrideFeatureFlag()` to override a feature flag
persistently (within the tab/page session).
4. In non-development (Staging and Production) environments, feature flags are defined in Terraform.
5. Deploy feature flags to Staging and Production environments incrementally, and do not remove
feature flags to "un-gate" a feature that is considered ready for Production use.
6. Once a feature flag is no longer needed (i.e. the feature is fully adopted or abandoned),
remove them in order to keep the codebase free of unnecessary complexity.

### Development

In development environments, the `window.APP_CONFIG.featureFlags` object is defined within
the `packages/client/public/deploy-config.js` file. You may modify this file to add, remove,
or change the value of any feature flag that pertains to your work. In general, all feature
flags that are currently used in Staging and/or Production environments should be defined in
this file so that other contributors can easily find and reference them. Use your judgement
(and/or discuss with the team!) when determining an appropriate value for a feature flag
when committing changes to this file.

It is important to note that the git-tracked `packages/client/public/deploy-config.js` file
is excluded from non-development website builds that are deployed to Staging and Production
environments, so any changes made to this file will **not** be represented in a deployment.

#### Coding Guidelines

Regardless of the configured value of a particular feature flag, the code that evaluates a
feature flag's value is ultimately responsible for the effective behavior.

Take care to observe the following guidelines when implementing code that makes use of feature flags:

1. Always evaluate a feature flag strictly, and always use the strict equality (`===`) operator
when comparing to another value – do not use "truthy"/"falsey" evaluations.
2. Treat feature flags as inactive-by-default. In other words, code that expects a boolean
feature flag should consider its value as `false` if the feature flag is `undefined`, `null`,
a non-boolean value, or any value other than `true`.
3. Where reasonable, avoid caching or otherwise persisting behaviors informed by a feature
flag's value beyond the immediate validation. This practice helps keep feature flag behaviors
obvious, avoids developer confusion, and allows dynamic modification of flag values in a browser
development console during testing.
4. Always define "getter" functions for feature flags via the library defined in the
`packages/client/src/helpers/featureFlags` directory, and avoid directly accessing the
`window.APP_CONFIG.featureFlags` object elsewhere.
5. Treat the `window.APP_CONFIG.featureFlags` object as read-only; **never** assign a value
to this object or any of its properties outside of `deploy-config.js`, as doing so creates
unpredictable behavior.

#### Accessing Values

Whenever you start using a new feature flag, define a helper function used to access and evaluate
the flag in `packages/client/src/helpers/featureFlags/index.js`. Generally these functions will
be fairly simple, but they should make sure to guard against errors and other unexpected behaviors
in cases where a feature flag is not defined or has an unexpected value (see
[Coding Guidelines](#coding-guidelines) for more information). Elsewhere in code, call this
new function in order to retrieve the state of the feature flag throughout the rest of the
`packages/client` codebase, rather than accessing the `window.APP_CONFIG.featureFlags` object
directly.

### Deploying

In non-development environments (particularly Staging and Production), feature flags are configured
in Terraform, which is responsible for populating and deploying `deploy-config.js` to each
target environment. In order to configure a feature flag for non-development environments,
update the `website_feature_flags` input variable defined in the `.tfvars` file that pertains
to each environment that you want to configure. As a general best practice, feature flags
should be represented in each of the `.tfvars` files, although the respective value for each
feature flag will often be different.

Normally, a feature flag is set to an "inactive" value that is representative of the normal/default
behavior (i.e. where the feature does not currently exist) in `terraform/prod.tfvars` until it has
been approved as ready for Production. By contrast, a feature that should be available in our
for colllaborative QA activities in our Staging environment should be set to an "active" value
that enables the new behavior in `staging.tfvars`. Do note that features which are in a highly
unstable phase of development or would otherwise be generally disruptive to Staging environment
activities should be set to an inactive value.

**If you are unsure of what constitutes an appropriate value for a feature flag in any environment,
reach out to the team for discussion!**

#### Deploying to Production

Code that has been developed around a feature flag should always be initially deployed to Production
with the feature flag in-place, initially in a disabled/inactive state. Once the feature is ready
to be exposed to users in Production (meaning it has been approved by the team), configure its
"active" value in `terraform/prod.tfvars` – the code responsible for gating behaviors based on
the feature flag should remain unmodified when the feature is first released, which allows it
to be more easily deactivated if a problem is identified.

### Dynamically Modifying Flag Values

In some cases, it may be useful to dynamically modify the value of a feature flag within the
browser development console. This is especially true in environments like Staging and Production,
where the `deploy-config.js` file cannot be modified outside of a deployment, but may also
be useful in development environments where you want to quickly test different values for a
feature flag. In these cases, flags may be overridden for an individual page session (i.e.
within a particular tab, across reloads) by calling `window.APP_CONFIG.overrideFeatureFlag(k, v)`,
where `k` is the name of the feature flag and `v` is the desired override value.

Feature flag overrides set by calling this function are persisted in the
[`window.SessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage)
property's, which is bound to the current page (tab) session and will allow overrides to remain
in-place even if the page is reloaded. Additionally, multiple tabs can have different overrides
configured, allowing for side-by-side comparision of different feature flag configurations
across different tabs.

To reset feature flag overrides, you can do any of the following:
- Close the tab.
- Call `window.sessionStorage.removeItem('featureFlags')`.
- Call `window.sessionStorage.clear()` (note that this will clear all values set in
  `window.sessionStorage`, including those that are unrelated to feature flags).

**Important:** When set, `window.sessionStorage.featureFlags` is expected to be a JSON-serialized
object string. Although possible, modifying `window.sessionStorage.featureFlags` directly
is not advised; you should use `window.APP_CONFIG.overrideFeatureFlag()` to set a discrete
feature flag value, or else use one of the methods listed above to completely reset any/all
existing overrides.

Note that it is possible to create and assign feature flag values by modifying the
`window.APP_CONFIG.featureFlags` object directly via the development console. However, these
direct modifications will not be retained after a page reload.

### Cleanup

Feature flags are normally meant to be temporary, and used when a feature or one of its behaviors
is not completely ready for users in a Production environment, *or* when a feature that was
developed with a feature flag is first being deployed. Eventually, once the feature is deemed
stable and more or less permanent, it should be removed.

To safely remove a feature flag, follow these steps:
1. Identify calls to its corresponding helper function defined in
`packages/client/src/helpers/featureFlags/index.js`.
2. Remove those calls, taking care to update the calling code so that the previously-conditional
behaviors are now static and consistently treat the feature as active. Once you have updated
all references to the helper function, remove it from
`packages/client/src/helpers/featureFlags/index.js`.
3. Remove the feature flag definition from `packages/client/public/deploy-config.js`
4. Test in your development environment to ensure that the feature is intact. When testing,
watch for console errors (e.g. `ReferenceError`) to ensure that no calls to the now-undefined
function still remain.
5. Remove the feature flag definition from the `website_feature_flags` Terraform input variable
from all `.tfvars` files in the `terraform` directory.
